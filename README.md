# supabase-auth-storage-template
A fully working starter that shows how to implement user authentication, secure image uploads, row-level security, and a public image feed using Supabase. Built with Next.js and Tailwind, this template gives you everything you need to create an image-based app—from personal galleries to community walls—with clean, extendable code.
